## What is Xiaozhi?

Xiaozhi is an open-source ESP32-based AI chatbot that uses voice interaction and MCP protocol to control various smart home devices and services. It supports multiple ESP32 platforms and can integrate with various AI models like Qwen and DeepSeek.

- **All-in-one hardware:** ESP32-S3 (16 MB flash / 8 MB PSRAM), digital mic, speaker with class-D amp and 1.28‚Äì1.85‚Ä≥ colour LCD.
- **Local wake word + cloud intelligence:** an offline wake-word engine runs on the device; after activation audio is sent to Xiaozhi‚Äôs servers where ASR, LLM reasoning (Qwen, DeepSeek, Doubao ‚Ä¶), and TTS are performed.
- **Voice-only Home-Assistant control:** this HACS integration connects the device to Home Assistant MCP, letting you toggle lights, scenes and more entirely by voice.
- **Many shapes, same guts:** boards are sold as square dev-kits, cubes, pucks and the cute **‚ÄúAstronaut Ball‚Äù** shown above ‚Äì all share the same firmware stack.
- **Ultra-low cost:** the Astronaut Ball costs **‚âà USD 19** ‚Äì cheaper than most bare ESP32 kits. [AliExpress product page](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008600891141.html)

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.1.0 or later
- HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)
- **Home Assistant MCP Server Integration** (must be installed first)
- Xiaozhi ESP32 device or compatible hardware
- Active internet connection for MCP communication

## Installation

### Prerequisites: Install Home Assistant MCP Server

Before installing this integration, you **must** install the official Home Assistant MCP Server integration:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=mcp_server)

1. Go to `Settings` > `Devices & Services` > `Add Integration`
2. Search for "Model Context Protocol Server" (or "MCP Server")
3. Install and configure the MCP Server integration
4. The MCP server will run locally within your Home Assistant instance at `http://localhost:8123/mcp_server/sse`
5. Make sure to configure entity exposure in the MCP Server settings

### HACS Installation (Recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=mac8005&repository=xiaozhi-mcp-ha&category=integration)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click on "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/mac8005/xiaozhi-mcp-ha`
6. Set category to "Integration"
7. Click "Add"
8. Search for "Xiaozhi MCP" and install
9. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Download the `xiaozhi_mcp` folder from this repository
2. Copy it to `config/custom_components/xiaozhi_mcp/` in your Home Assistant installation
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Step 1: Create Long-Lived Access Token

1. Go to your Home Assistant Profile: `Settings` > `People` > `Users` > Click on your user
2. Scroll down to "Long-lived access tokens"
3. Click "Create Token"
4. Give it a name like "Xiaozhi MCP"
5. Copy the token (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Get Xiaozhi MCP Endpoint

1. Visit [xiaozhi.me](https://xiaozhi.me/) and create an account
2. Go to the MCP section in your dashboard
3. Copy your MCP endpoint URL

### Step 3: Configure Integration

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=xiaozhi_mcp)

1. Go to `Settings` > `Devices & Services` > `Add Integration`
2. Search for "Xiaozhi MCP"
3. Enter your configuration:
   - **Name**: Friendly name for the integration
   - **Xiaozhi MCP Endpoint**: Your xiaozhi.me MCP endpoint URL
   - **Long-Lived Access Token**: Token created in Step 1
   - **Scan Interval**: How often to check connection status (default: 30 seconds)
   - **Enable Logging**: Enable detailed logging for debugging

## How It Works

This integration acts as a **bridge/proxy** between your Xiaozhi ESP32 device and the official Home Assistant MCP Server:

1. **Xiaozhi ESP32** connects to the Xiaozhi cloud service
2. **Xiaozhi cloud** sends MCP requests to this integration via WebSocket
3. **This integration** forwards the MCP requests to the local **Home Assistant MCP Server** via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
4. **Home Assistant MCP Server** (at `http://localhost:8123/mcp_server/sse`) processes the requests and controls your Home Assistant entities
5. **Responses** are sent back through the same chain

```text
[Xiaozhi ESP32] ‚Üê‚Üí [Xiaozhi Cloud] ‚Üê‚Üí [This Integration] ‚Üê‚Üí [HA MCP Server] ‚Üê‚Üí [Home Assistant]
                                         (MCP Proxy)      (SSE: /mcp_server/sse)
```

**Key Architecture Points:**

- ‚úÖ **No MCP Server Reimplementation**: This integration does NOT implement its own MCP server
- ‚úÖ **Uses Official MCP Server**: All MCP functionality is provided by the official Home Assistant MCP Server integration
- ‚úÖ **Acts as SSE Proxy**: This integration forwards MCP messages to the official MCP server via Server-Sent Events
- ‚úÖ **Secure Local Communication**: All Home Assistant communication happens locally through the official MCP server
- ‚úÖ **No External URLs Required**: No need to expose your Home Assistant instance to the internet

## Usage

Once configured, your Xiaozhi device can:

- Control lights: "Turn on the living room lights"
- Check sensors: "What's the temperature in the bedroom?"
- Control climate: "Set the thermostat to 72 degrees"
- Run automations: "Activate movie mode"
- Get device status: "Is the front door locked?"

## Configuration Options

| Option             | Description                       | Required | Default |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| `name`             | Friendly name for the integration | Yes      | -       |
| `xiaozhi_endpoint` | Xiaozhi MCP endpoint URL          | Yes      | -       |
| `access_token`     | Long-lived access token           | Yes      | -       |
| `scan_interval`    | Status check interval (seconds)   | No       | 30      |
| `enable_logging`   | Enable detailed logging           | No       | False   |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issue: "Device only controls volume/screen, not lights"

If your Xiaozhi device says it only knows how to control volume and screen when you ask it to control Home Assistant entities, this is likely an **entity exposure** issue:

**Symptoms:**
- Integration connects successfully 
- Device responds to voice commands
- But device says it doesn't know how to control lights, switches, etc.
- Logs show "Could not find session ID" or 404 errors

**Solution:**
1. **Check Entity Exposure Status**: Look at the "Entity Exposure Status" sensor created by this integration
2. **Configure MCP Server**: Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Devices & Services` ‚Üí `Model Context Protocol Server`
3. **Expose Entities**: Make sure the entities you want to control (lights, switches, climate, etc.) are exposed to the MCP server
4. **Restart**: Restart Home Assistant after changing entity exposure settings
5. **Test**: Use the `xiaozhi_mcp.check_entity_exposure` service to verify entities are properly exposed

### Important Notes

- **Critical Dependency**: This integration requires the official Home Assistant MCP Server integration to be installed and running
- **No MCP Server Reimplementation**: This integration does NOT implement its own MCP server - it only acts as a proxy
- **SSE Communication**: Uses Server-Sent Events to communicate with the MCP Server at `http://localhost:8123/mcp_server/sse`
- **Entity Exposure**: Make sure to expose the entities you want to control via the MCP Server settings in Home Assistant
- **Local Communication**: All Home Assistant communication happens locally through the official MCP server
- **No External URLs**: No need to configure external Home Assistant URLs or expose your instance to the internet

### Available Services

This integration provides helpful services for troubleshooting:

- `xiaozhi_mcp.reconnect`: Force reconnection to Xiaozhi endpoint
- `xiaozhi_mcp.send_message`: Send a test message
- `xiaozhi_mcp.check_entity_exposure`: Check which entities are exposed to MCP server

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging by adding to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.xiaozhi_mcp: debug
```
